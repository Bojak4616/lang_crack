Lang_crack is a PoC for cracking password hashes with plaintext in the following languauges:
<li>English</li>
<li>Russian</li>
<li>Korean</li>
<li>Chinese/Japanese</li>

TODO:
<li>Fix bug when using wl option that switches the order of the hash_file and the wordlist_file</li>
<li>Have cracking end when all hashes in the hash_file have been exausted</li>
<li>Add functionality to specify password length</li>
<li>Comment code (oops should have been done while coding, got carried away)</li>

This PoC lays out the template that would ideally be used in openGL with C/C++ for optimization
